# Bayesian inference and prediction in linear regression models with continous and binary response variables

Currently implemented in the 'bayes-linear' package are 1.) a binary probit model using variational inference and MCMC (Gibbs sampling) and 2.) a Student-t linear regression model for robust inference in case of heavy-tailed response variables using Gibbs sampling. All implementations are purely based on numpy, scipy and pandas.
